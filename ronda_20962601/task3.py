Task 3: Digit Recognition using Custom CNN

Recognizes digits using a CNN trained on MNIST dataset.
Assignment requirement: Cannot use pre-made OCR (like Tesseract).

CNN Architecture:
- Input: 28×28 grayscale images
- 2 Conv layers (32 and 64 filters) with max pooling
- Dense layer with dropout (0.5) to prevent overfitting
- Output: 10 classes (digits 0-9)
- Training: 99.21% accuracy on MNIST

The Key Challenge - Preprocessing:
Initial approach: Direct resize to 28×28 → Only 33% accuracy
Problem: Squishing tall digits distorted their shape
- "0" became oval-shaped → model confused it with "8" or "3"
- "1" became wider → model confused it with "7"

Solution - Aspect Ratio Preservation:
1. Resize to fit within 20×20 (maintaining proportions)
2. Center the resized digit in a 28×28 canvas
3. Add padding around edges (like MNIST format)
Result: 83.3% accuracy (10/12 correct)

This preprocessing approach was the most significant improvement.
Real-world digits differ from MNIST (printed vs handwritten), but
maintaining their natural proportions helped bridge that gap.

Performance: 83.3% accuracy (10/12 characters)
Pass requirement: ≥50% ✓ ACHIEVED
